IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: "Intelligent Append & Resample" Architecture
====================================================================

This document summarizes the key changes made to fix the real-time data engine.

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Old system used TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY which only returned previous day's data (1-day lag)
- New system uses GLOBAL_QUOTE endpoint for true real-time data

KEY CHANGES MADE:

1. convert_global_quote_to_dataframe():
   BEFORE: Used 'latest_trading_day' timestamp (static, previous day)
   AFTER:  Uses current timestamp rounded to minute boundary (real-time)

2. intelligent_append_or_update() (replaces merge_new_candles):
   NEW LOGIC:
   - If live quote is in SAME minute as last candle: UPDATE existing candle
     * high = max(existing_high, new_high)
     * low = min(existing_low, new_low) 
     * close = new_close
     * open stays the same
   - If live quote is in NEW minute: APPEND new candle

3. process_ticker_realtime():
   ENHANCED WORKFLOW:
   - Step 1: Fetch Live Quote (GLOBAL_QUOTE)
   - Step 2: Load 1-Minute History (full 7-day _1min.csv)
   - Step 3: Intelligently Append or Update
   - Step 4: Save 1-Minute File
   - Step 5: Resample to 30-Minute Data
   - Step 6: Save 30-Minute File (trimmed to 500 rows)

4. resample_1min_to_30min():
   NEW FUNCTION: Creates 30-minute data from perfected 1-minute data
   - Aggregation: open='first', high='max', low='min', close='last', volume='sum'
   - Automatically trims to 500 rows as per production requirements

VALIDATION:
✅ All tests pass for same-minute updates and new-minute appends
✅ 30-minute resampling works correctly  
✅ Script maintains backward compatibility
✅ No breaking changes to existing interfaces

The system now provides TRUE real-time updates instead of 1-day lagged data.
