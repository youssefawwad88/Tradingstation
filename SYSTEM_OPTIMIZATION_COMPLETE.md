@screener_plugin(name="my_strategy", version="1.0")
class MyScreener(BaseScreener):
    async def screen_ticker(self, ticker, df, **kwargs):
        # Implement strategy logic
        if strategy_condition_met:
            return self.create_signal(
                ticker=ticker,
                signal_type="buy", 
                entry_price=100.0
            )
        return None
```

```python
from core.logging_system import get_logger
from core.metrics import increment_counter, time_operation

logger = get_logger(__name__)

def process_data():
    with time_operation("data_processing"):
        # Process data
        increment_counter("data_processed")
        logger.info("Data processed successfully", count=100)
```

### Health Check Integration
```python
from core.health_monitor import get_health_monitor

async def check_custom_service():
    # Custom health check logic
    return {"status": "healthy", "response_time": 0.05}

# Register custom health check
monitor = get_health_monitor()
monitor.register_check(HealthCheck(
    "custom_service", 
    check_custom_service,
    critical=True
))
```
