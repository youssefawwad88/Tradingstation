# Production Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Code Changes Completed

### 1. Test Mode Removal
- [x] Removed `TEST_MODE = True` flag from orchestrator/run_all.py
- [x] Replaced test logic with full production scheduling
- [x] All scripts now run independently without test dependencies

### 2. Logging Implementation  
- [x] Added structured logging to all screener files
- [x] Replaced debug print statements with appropriate log levels
- [x] Added logging to job files and dashboard
- [x] Log levels: INFO for operations, ERROR for failures, DEBUG for detailed info

### 3. Production Scheduling Implementation
- [x] Daily data fetching: 5:00 PM ET (1 job)
- [x] 1-minute intraday updates: Every minute 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET (390 jobs)
- [x] 30-minute intraday updates: Every 15 minutes 4:00 AM - 8:00 PM ET (64 jobs)
- [x] Gap & Go pre-market: Every 30 minutes 7:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET (5 jobs)
- [x] Gap & Go regular: Every minute 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM ET (61 jobs)
- [x] ORB screener: Once at 9:40 AM ET (1 job)
- [x] Hourly screeners (AVWAP, EMA, Breakout, Exhaustion): Every hour 6:00 AM - 7:00 PM ET (14 jobs)
- [x] Signal consolidation: Every 5 minutes during market hours (78 jobs)

**Total: 614 scheduled jobs**

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience
- [x] Independent job execution (failures don't crash entire sequence)
- [x] Proper exception handling with logging
- [x] Market hours validation to prevent unnecessary execution
- [x] 30-minute timeout per job to prevent hanging
- [x] Modular job design with status tracking

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- [x] Reduced excessive print statements for better performance
- [x] Structured logging reduces I/O overhead
- [x] Market hours checking prevents unnecessary API calls
- [x] Independent job scheduling allows parallel execution when needed

## ðŸš€ Deployment Requirements

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set DigitalOcean Spaces credentials:
  - `SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `SPACES_BUCKET_NAME`
  - `SPACES_REGION`
  - `SPACES_ENDPOINT_URL`

- [ ] Set Alpha Vantage API key (if needed)

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run production orchestrator
python orchestrator/run_all.py
```

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor logs at `/tmp/orchestrator.log`
- [ ] Check scheduler status in cloud storage: `data/logs/scheduler_status.csv`
- [ ] Use Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring
