# DigitalOcean Build Cache Clear Instructions

## Problem Statement
The production environment is in an inconsistent state where the orchestrator has been updated to VERSION 2.0 but the data_fetch_manager is still running an old version. This is causing the missing "--- DATA FETCH MANAGER VERSION 2.0 RUNNING ---" log message.

## Root Cause
DigitalOcean App Platform build cache is corrupted/stale, causing some files to be updated while others remain old.

## Solution: Manual DigitalOcean Dashboard Actions Required

### Step 1: Clear Build Cache
1. **Log in** to your DigitalOcean account dashboard
2. **Navigate** to the "Apps" section 
3. **Select** your tradestation application
4. **Go** to the "Settings" tab for your application
5. **Scroll down** to find the configuration for your tradestation-worker component
6. **Look for** an option related to the build process - should be a button or link that says **"Clear Build Cache"** or similar
7. **Click** the "Clear Build Cache" button

### Step 2: Trigger Fresh Deployment
1. **Go** to the "Actions" menu in the top-right corner of the app dashboard
2. **Select** "Deploy" to trigger a new, completely fresh deployment
3. **Wait** for the deployment to complete

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. **Go** to the "Deployments" tab 
2. **Watch** the new deployment until it shows "Active" and successful
3. **Open** the "Runtime Logs" for your tradestation-worker component

## Success Criteria
After the fresh deployment, you MUST see all three diagnostic log messages appear in the correct order for a single job run:

### 1. Orchestrator Startup
```
--- ORCHESTRATOR VERSION 2.0 RUNNING [DEPLOYMENT v...] ---
```

### 2. Job Command Execution
```
ORCHESTRATOR: Preparing to execute command: '...data_fetch_manager.py --interval 1min'
```

### 3. Data Fetch Manager Startup
```
--- DATA FETCH MANAGER VERSION 2.0 RUNNING [DEPLOYMENT v...] ---
```

## Verification
- **Local verification**: Run `python3 verify_deployment.py` to confirm code is correct
- **Production verification**: Check runtime logs for all three messages above
- **Data processing**: Should see logs like "Downloading master_tickerlist.csv...", "Processing Ticker: SPY..."
- **Performance**: Job runtime should increase significantly as data processing resumes

## Next Steps After Success
1. âœ… Confirm all three diagnostic messages appear in production logs
2. âœ… Verify data processing logs resume (CSV downloads, ticker processing)
3. âœ… Check that CSV files in Spaces bucket begin updating
4. âœ… Monitor job performance and completion times
5. ðŸ”„ Proceed with "Super Cleanup" task if needed

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT** modify code during this process - the issue is deployment environment, not code
- **WAIT** for complete deployment before checking logs
- **MONITOR** logs immediately after deployment completes
- **CLEAR CACHE FIRST** - this is the critical step that forces fresh build
