## Development Workflow

1. Work in the `dev` branch for all development
2. Test changes thoroughly before merging
3. Follow the coding standards below
4. Update documentation for any API changes

## Coding Standards

- Use type hints throughout
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- No global state - pass context explicitly

## Testing

- Run `pytest` before submitting changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

## Code Quality

- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `ruff` for linting
- Use `mypy` for type checking

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation files
- Include docstrings with parameters and return types
- Add examples for complex functionality
