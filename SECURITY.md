## Security Measures

### API Security
- API keys are never stored in code
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- Request/response logging excludes sensitive data

### Data Protection
- Local data encrypted at rest when possible
- Cloud storage uses encryption in transit and at rest
- No personal trading data stored without explicit consent
- Data retention policies enforced

### Code Security
- Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- Input validation on all external data
- SQL injection prevention (though we don't use SQL directly)
- Path traversal protection

### Infrastructure Security
- Least privilege access principles
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Keys
- Store API keys in environment variables only
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use read-only API keys when possible

### Environment Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use virtual environments
- Enable TEST_MODE for development
- Monitor system logs for anomalies

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Consider VPN for production deployments
- Implement firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic

## Known Security Considerations

### Alpha Vantage API
- Rate limits enforced to prevent API key suspension
- API responses cached temporarily in memory only
- No API key validation in TEST_MODE

### Data Storage
- Local files stored in user directory by default
- Cloud storage credentials required for production
- File permissions set appropriately
- Temporary files cleaned up

### Logging
- API keys filtered from log output
- Sensitive trading data not logged by default
- Log rotation implemented
- Log file permissions restricted
